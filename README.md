# Betting-Tool-for-Serbian-Bookmakers
we primarily work on surebetting, but recently we are transitioning towards value betting.

I also realize that automation in some processes is necessary, and advanced tools are a need, not a luxury. It has been very difficult for me to find a programmer from Serbia who understands my requirements, as most programmers are not deeply familiar with the subject, and what is actually needed here is someone with experience directly from the gambling world.

I have completed several projects, but to be honest, maintaining those programs has always been a problem for me because programmers lose motivation for further maintenance and additional issues that arise after the project is completed once they are paid.

I primarily want to establish a good relationship with you and understand that you are the one who will meet all my requirements so that we can embark on a series of projects together. I already have 2-3 ready, and I am also open to your advice and suggestions on what other tools could be developed.

Several of my workers are exclusively engaged in live surebetting, while I have been focused on pregame value betting for the past two months, designing the best mechanism for generating profit. Over these 18 years, we have learned many tricks; some have been removed by bookmakers, but some still persist, and we constantly improve and upgrade them.

If you want, I can give you a few suggestions on what currently interests me, and I see that you have time, so we could get straight to work.

I focus on Serbian bookmakers because I live here and can acquire a large number of user accounts at very favorable prices, which allows me to generate profit by playing value bets, surebets, or any other profitable game.

I have had experience with bots, and it did not turn out well because, due to their high efficiency, they were easily detected by the risk reviewers of the bookmakers. One of the advantages of living in Serbia is that we have several thousand deposit locations where I, along with a team of 4 field workers in 4 different cities, can generate profit without using user accounts. Tickets placed directly at the bookmaker's location pass much more easily than those made from accounts.

In the last 2 months, I have used Rebel Betting, but for filtering matches, I used filters from foreign bookmakers and then manually searched in domestic ones. When I say manually, I used a tool that is available with a subscription and is very well-known in Serbia. It is a comparison site for the complete offers of 80% of Serbian bookmakers and works very well. The updates are correct every 145 seconds (of course, it can be better, but for 40 EUR per month, it’s perfect).

In this introductory part, I’m interested to know if you think it’s possible to compare odds directly from this comparison program with, say, Pinnacle and Betfair. I would also need to add one more "soft" bookmaker that quickly adjusts margins, like Bet365, to compare odds and margins (basketball) with Serbian bookmakers. I noticed there is huge value here because when playing value bets with Rebel Betting, a large percentage of bets are on basketball games, as Serbian bookmakers, for some reason, adjust those margins a bit slower compared to the odds in football offers.

The first option is to consider the offer and compare it with Betfair, Pinnacle, and one soft bookmaker, while the second option is to take only the top 3 bookmakers in Serbia that interest me for betting and create a whole project from scratch. This would certainly be much more work, but the product would be mine, and I wouldn’t have to depend on other factors. In the case of the second option, I would significantly reduce the filter for browsing the offer and narrow it down only to what interests me.

For many years, I have been using the Green Ensurebet program, which covers the Mozzart bookmaker, the most well-known one here, and after all this time, I have noticed where they make mistakes.

I would also move on to the next project, which is closely related to the first one, concerning the comparison of odds and margins for the player points market. I have already created this project twice, and neither time was it completed to perfection. After some time, they became useless to me. It is very difficult to communicate and explain what I want to someone who is not from the gambling world. Both margins and odds, as well as response time (refresh rate), are important.
The programmer cannot just take the money and disappear; they must leave an option for constant maintenance of the site and for adding new players to the offer.

The first obstacle is related to integrating the program and reading player names, as in different bookmakers, a basketball player might be referred to differently, for example, C. Jones, Cris Jones, Jones, Cr. Jones. This caused significant problems for us last time. There is also the issue that the programmer wants to input all players as quickly as possible, finish the project, and run off with the money, but I might find that a player who was injured during the development period returns to play, and the program doesn’t recognize that player because they were never loaded into the database.

Regarding this program, I know exactly how I want it to look and how it should display information; I just need the programming side to execute it properly and do everything correctly. You can count on help with reading players and their names, as that is a task any amateur can handle, and for you, it would be a waste of valuable time that isn’t cheap.

What experience do you have with live betting? Bookmakers in Serbia mostly use BetRadar live, which makes a lot of mistakes, especially after a goal or a red card is scored. Although hundreds of bookmakers worldwide use BetRadar, it is far from perfect. For example, in today’s match Liverpool - Fulham, after the red card for the home team at a score of 0:1, it offered a coefficient of 2.47, which was much higher than the market 1.8 that Betfair was offering at that moment. Such things appear and last a few seconds, max 1 minute, after which the odds are corrected. If there is any tool that could recognize this and place bets, in my opinion, this could be treated as value betting. The other option, which I’m not a fan of, is to do a suebet where odds would be directly sold on Betfair (I prefer SharpExchange). I hope you are up to date with developments in the gambling world and have heard of SharpExchange, which was created as a counterpart to Orbit, but the commission is only 2.5%. I’m not sure if they have started providing an API since the project is still in development; they started operations but rushed to launch the business before finishing everything.
Do you have experience with streaming? They are an upgrade to courtside betting. For a long time, people from all over the world have been making profits this way, but the last year has been much worse, and it can be concluded that this type of betting is slowly declining and needs modifications. A large team of people in Serbia is making a profit by using the speed of the stream and placing live bets on basketball games where they gain an advantage, but it’s not a guaranteed profit like it used to be with football matches, where players would bet on which team would score the next goal. Times are changing, and one needs to be clever and creative.

Creating automated betting solutions, especially in fields like value betting, surebetting, and live betting, requires a deep understanding of the mechanics of sports betting and advanced development tools. Based on your needs, here are a few ways to approach these projects, as well as technical solutions and strategies that could help you automate these processes effectively.
Approach to Developing a Betting Tool for Serbian Bookmakers

    Understanding the Betting Landscape: Since you have experience in Serbian sports betting and use bookmakers like Pinnacle, Betfair, and local ones like Mozzart, it is crucial to focus on:
        Market Data Collection: Collecting odds data from these sources (via scraping or APIs, where available).
        Odds Comparison: Implementing tools that will allow you to compare odds across these bookmakers.
        Timing and Margins: Ensure the automation tools are efficient in tracking the odds and margins, especially for fast-moving markets like basketball and football.

Key Considerations for Developing Automated Betting Tools:

    Data Scraping & API Integration: To compare the odds across different bookmakers, scraping data from the Serbian comparison site or directly through API integration will be essential. You can integrate APIs like Betfair and Pinnacle to fetch odds in real-time, while local bookmakers might require a scraping solution if APIs are unavailable.

    Player Name Recognition: Player name discrepancies (like C. Jones, Cris Jones, etc.) can be a significant issue in data parsing. You can use the following approaches:
        Name Normalization: Implement fuzzy string matching or create a dictionary to map player names to their canonical form.
        AI Models: You can use machine learning models to detect and match player names across different betting platforms.

    Live Betting: Live betting data is particularly challenging, especially with the issues surrounding the timing of odds and the market refresh rates. BetRadar, the provider you mentioned, often has inaccuracies in fast-changing sports like basketball.
        Fixing Incorrect Odds: Develop an algorithm to track discrepancies in odds between BetRadar and Betfair or Pinnacle and place bets when errors appear.
        Response Time: Optimizing the timing of bet placements requires high-frequency polling of odds data (perhaps every 5-10 seconds) and a low-latency system to ensure you can place bets before the odds correct.

    Player Points Market Comparison: If you plan to automate comparison for player points betting, you will need to track players’ individual performance stats in addition to odds and margins. This could involve:
        Real-time Scraping: Fetch data from basketball games in real-time (e.g., points scored, fouls, assists, etc.).
        Tracking Data Sources: Use official APIs or scraping tools that track sports data from sources like Basketball Reference, BetRadar, or directly from bookmakers’ websites.

Steps to Develop a Betting Bot:

    Designing the System:
        Data Collection: Write a scraper or use APIs to collect data from multiple bookmakers.
            API for Pinnacle/Betfair: Use available APIs to pull odds data.
            Scraper for Serbian Bookmakers: If APIs aren’t available, use a web scraper to collect data.
        Data Normalization: Ensure the data is clean and consistently formatted, particularly for player names and markets.
        Odds Comparison Algorithm: Develop algorithms to compare odds across various bookmakers and identify discrepancies.
        Bet Placement: Develop a system that automatically places bets based on predefined criteria (e.g., value betting or sure betting).

    Building a Betting Algorithm:
        Value Betting Strategy: Implement a statistical model to identify situations where bookmakers offer value odds (e.g., using historical data and market analysis).
        Surebetting: Develop an arbitrage betting algorithm that compares odds from multiple bookmakers and identifies arbitrage opportunities.
        Live Betting Analysis: Track live odds and place bets when discrepancies appear, especially after events like a red card or injury that might not be reflected immediately in odds.

    User Interface (Optional):
        Dashboard: A web-based dashboard for users to manage bets, see current bets placed, and track ongoing live events.
        Notifications: Set up notifications when new betting opportunities are detected (e.g., discrepancies in live odds or player markets).

    Maintenance & Updates:
        Since you mentioned difficulties in maintaining programs with previous developers, you’ll need a system that allows for easy updates and monitoring. This includes:
            Logging: Implement logging systems to monitor errors and track the performance of the betting system.
            Real-time Data Updates: Ensure that data scraping or API pulling is done in real-time with fallback mechanisms in case data sources change their structure.

    Automation Tools:
        Task Scheduler: Use cron jobs or task schedulers to automate tasks like odds scraping, data comparison, and bet placements at defined intervals (e.g., every minute or second depending on the sport).
        Error Handling: Build a robust error-handling mechanism to detect and fix issues such as missing odds or mismatched player data.

Technical Stack for the Project:

    Programming Languages:
        Python: For scraping, API calls, data manipulation, and integration with odds comparison.
        Node.js: For building a real-time service to handle live betting data and placing bets.
        JavaScript (with Node.js or React): For building a user interface and notifications system.

    Libraries and Frameworks:
        BeautifulSoup / Scrapy (Python): For web scraping.
        Selenium: For handling dynamic web pages that require interaction (if scraping is done from a website).
        pandas / NumPy: For statistical analysis and data processing.
        TensorFlow / Scikit-Learn: For machine learning-based player name normalization and odds prediction.

    Data Sources:
        Betfair API / Pinnacle API: For real-time odds and market data.
        BetRadar: For live odds data, despite some of the inaccuracies you've noted.
        Official Sports APIs: For player stats, game data, etc. (e.g., Sportradar, Basketball-Reference).

    Database:
        MySQL / PostgreSQL: For storing odds data, betting history, and user preferences.
        MongoDB: If you prefer a NoSQL database for flexible and quick storage.

Challenges & Future Enhancements:

    Live Betting with Correcting Odds: As you’ve noted, there’s a huge opportunity in detecting discrepancies in live odds, especially after events like red cards or injuries. You can create a system that alerts you to these opportunities and automates the betting process.

    Player Recognition System: If you're building a player-based betting tool (e.g., for basketball player points), you’ll need to refine the player recognition system. Consider building a custom player database with multiple variations of names and ensuring it’s constantly updated.

    Streamlining Data: As you mentioned that live betting is gradually declining, focusing on more stable betting markets like pre-game or value betting might be a better long-term strategy. However, incorporating streaming technologies for live odds data could help improve betting decisions.

Summary:

Building an advanced betting system tailored to your specific needs (value betting, surebetting, live betting, and player market comparison) involves combining data scraping, APIs, statistical modeling, and automation tools. By creating a scalable system that allows for regular maintenance, logging, and real-time updates, you can ensure that the system remains functional and competitive in the fast-changing betting market.

Your approach of working closely with developers who understand the nuances of the betting world is critical to ensuring the success of these projects.
